Natural Disaster Search

Natural Disaster Search is a web application that will show you natural disasters in any area you would like to search. Maybe you are heading to California in the summer and want to check to see if there are wildfires in your area, with Natural disaster search you will get a radius of 100 miles from the location you search. 

We are utilizing 2 awesome APIs, Google Maps API and EONET by Nasa.
